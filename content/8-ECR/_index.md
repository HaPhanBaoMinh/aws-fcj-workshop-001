- Push container images to Amazon ECR without installing or scaling infrastructure, and pull images using any management tool.

- Share and download images securely over Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) with automatic encryption and access controls.

- Access and distribute your images faster, reduce download times, and improve availability using a scalable, durable architecture.

#### Use cases

- **Manage software vulnerabilities**: Meet your image compliance security requirements using the tightly integrated Amazon Inspector vulnerability management service to automate vulnerability assessment scanning and remediation ticket routing.

- **Streamline your deployment workloads**: Publish containerized applications with a single command and easily integrate your self-managed environments.

- **Manage image lifecycle policies**: Automatically preserve the most recent images and archive ones you donâ€™t need. Use rules and tagging to access images quickly.
