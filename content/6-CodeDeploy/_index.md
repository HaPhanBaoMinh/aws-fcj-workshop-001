- Automate and consistently deploy your applications  across your development, test, and production environments.

- Monitor fleet health and automatically roll back updates as necessary.

- Launch and track your application deployments' status through the AWS Management Console or AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

- Reuse your existing setup code and integrate with your existing software release process or continuous delivery toolchain.

#### Use cases

- **Automate deployments to remove manual operations**: Repeat an application deployment across different groups or instances using a file and command-based install model.

- **Deploy to many hosts**: Manage deployments to thousands of hosts with advanced monitoring and traffic shifting.

- **Use advanced deployment techniques**: Support multiple deployment types, including in-place, canary, and blue/green deployments.

- **Monitor health and rollback**: Configure alarms that will initiate rollbacks, and stop application deployments in progress.
