### 1. Overview

In this lab, we will walk through the process of setting up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy a simple server using AWS services including CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, EC2, CodeDeploy Agent, ECR, and Docker.

### 2. Objectives

The objective of this lab is to automate the deployment process of a simple server application to an EC2 instance by deploying a CI/CD pipeline. We will utilize AWS services to manage source code, build Docker images, and deploy the application automatically.
