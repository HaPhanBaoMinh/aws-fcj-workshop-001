- Avoid having to set up, manage, or patch your own build servers.

- Scale capacity automatically so builds aren't waiting in queue to run.

- Pay only for the build minutes that you use.

- Use prepackaged build environments or your own, and encrypt artifacts with your own keys.

#### Use cases

- **Automate continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines**: Create a fully automated software release process that promotes code changes through multiple deployment environments.

- **Remove the complexity of managing build servers**: Run your existing Jenkins build jobs on CodeBuild to remove the need for configuring and managing Jenkins build nodes.

- **Build source code hosted on GitHub**: Automatically initiate software builds using an existing GitHub repository and post the results back to GitHub.
