## AWS CodeCommit

#### Securely host highly scalable private Git repositories and collaborate on code

![CodeCBuild](/aws-fcj-workshop-001/2-CodeCommit/0.jpeg)

- Remove the need to host, maintain, back up, or scale your own source control servers.

- Customize user-specific access to your repositories with automatically encrypted files in transit.

- Keep your repositories highly available and accessible with scalable, redundant, and durable architecture.

- Maintain your repositories close to your build, staging, and production environments on AWS.

#### Use cases

- **Collaborate on code**: Implement workflows that include code reviews and feedback by default, and control who can make changes to specific branches.

- **Use your existing tools**: Keep using your preferred development environment plugins, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems, and graphical clients.

- **Receive notifications and custom scripts**: Get Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) notifications for events impacting your repositories, and send notifications to create HTTP webhooks.

- **Create up to 5,000 repositories by default**: Generate up to 25,000 additional repositories by request, and store and version any kind of file.
