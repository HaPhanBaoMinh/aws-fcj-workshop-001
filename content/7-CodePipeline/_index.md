- Model your software release process and mitigate the need to set up or provision servers.

- Define the stages of your software release process using the AWS Management Console or AWS command line interface (CLI).

- Rapidly release new features, iterating on feedback and catching bugs by testing each code change.

- Adapt to your needs using your own plugins, or prebuilt plugins, in any step of your release process.

#### Use cases

- **Define your pipeline structure**: Update existing pipelines and provide templates for creating new pipelines with a declarative JSON document.

- **Receive notifications for events**: Monitor events that impact your pipelines with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), which provides a status message and link to the source of the event.

- **Control and grant access**: Manage who can change and control your release workflow with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

- **Integrate your own custom systems**: Register a custom action and hook servers into your pipeline by integrating the CodePipeline open source agent with your servers.
